dubstep-track=Add dubstep to the trance and rave tracks improving their shaking, may cause joint damage.
hr=Intentionally contaminate phagnot stomachs with a genetic altered zogna bacteria able to break down the fibers of kicalks. Making their feeding 200% more effective, reducing costs.
socialization=Keeping phagnots in appropriate family groups encourages natural behaviours between individuals and rewarding relationships and interactions. Will speed up reproduction.
leader=Phagnots herds usually doesnt have a leader, inducing them do go against that behavior will provide another level of organization. The herd will be more productive.
igm=80% of effort is only worth 20% of the result. Run those unethical experiments on your cottonguts for 5x longer before slaughtering them. In return, their research data will be slightly more valuable.
ts=Provide your cottonguts with the highest quality meals. Boiled rat meat mixed with extracts from the moon shroom. Garnished with powdered seaweed and shredded acorn.
ud=Cottonguts are very sensitive to ultrasound. It affects them negatively. To avoid low reproduction rates install ultrasound dampers made from heavy metals in the walls of the prandium labs.
moon=Moondrops got their name because their flowers only open under the light from one of nauvis' moons. Install special, high-powered lamps into the greenhouse and improve production by constantly simulating nauvis moonlight.
cu=Moondrops have several copper-containing enzymes that play an important role in photosynthesis, respiration and the formation of lignin. This process requires soil rich in copper and is what gives them their distinct blueish colors. Nauvis soil naturally has trace amounts of copper however the addition of raw copper ore into their fertilization routine will improve the crop yield.
carbon-capture=Install small filters that will absorb escaping CO2 from the greenhouse, helping moondrops in their carbon capture. Allows self-sufficent produciton of CO2 without external inputs.

sun-concentration=Cover the ralesia's dome with a nano-ceramic layer that will help focus the sun light at the right level from the soil.
h2-recycle=Burn excess hydrogen to not only generate extra power for the enclosure, but use the water generated to irrigate the ralesias.
deadheading=Rennea blossoms sometimes die off quickly and become "deadheads". Re-program the plantation machinery to automatically detect and remove these defects. Using a special growth procedure, these deadheads can be recycled into useful native flora. 
alltime=Increasing irrigation will cause rennea flowers to become perennial. This technique will increase average growth speed, however extra electricity is required to pump all that water.
aphid-cleaning=A lack of genetic diversity causes renneas to be very susceptible to small pests such aphids. You have discovered that arqad venom can act as a great proto-pesticide.
unstable=The addition of a common dermal layer will allow for significant data collection of the alien environment.
ms=The addition of semi-rare galenic materials will provide improvements in the plasma control system and increase the speed of ionic measures in the mass-to-charge ratio of the object of study.
spg=The addition of a passivation layer will calm existing microorganisms in the substrate. Microscopes will render images in higher orders of magnitude of resolution.
mci=The addition of high-grade mova syrup will act as a preservative for the rare and expensive perfect samples. The likelyhood of cross-contamination is dramatically reduced by this technique.
neuron=Splicing an arthurian neural gen into scrondrix genoma will allow their brain cells to intercommunicate at near light speed, increasing their intelligence at a geometric scale. This procedure is very dangerous but it will result in significantly more neural material when slaughtered. If this material is eaten, it grants a temporary alien <-> human speech capability.
boronb=Scrondrix brain chemistry is completely diffrent to anything found on earth. Apparently, boron derivatives can act as a performance enchancing and hallucinogenic substance to scrondrix biology. By force-feeding boron trioxide they will gain a great reproductive boost.
hspa=Crosslink alkali dissociation in their intestines will allow scrondrixes to function on a pure vegan diet after maturation. A fully plant-based diet will generally lead to a reduction in overall energy and activity, espically in such a large mammal.
arcanium=Bombard simik's arcaniums (organs responsible for procreation) with microwaves can induce heat, boosting their production.
etelnav=Install patented Etelnav systems to use waste heat from that enclosure to generate power.
flagellum=Creates a new generation of sponges with triple the amount of flagellum in their choanocytes. These sponges form study skeletons in the growth medium and allow for the conversion of softer elements.
fragmentation=When a sponge grows enough, it will break fragment its own branches. If landed into a suitable substrate, their mesophyl will reshape and attach to the new place, making a new sponge.
bacterial=Mutate choanocytes to capture and engulf bacteria in the water, reducing the need of food and sterilizing the water.
mgo=Trits have metagenesis breeding cycles, which mean they have individuals just to grow and other just to procreate. Inserting a common ancient Earth gene from mammals can turn this creature into a complete typical breeding cycle leading to more offspring.
dc=Uses nanomachines to intentionally create non-depreciative mutations in trits DNA, allowing them to improve a lot their genetic poll and by that, improving your selective breeding.
nexelit-axis=Change the pressure pumps main axis for a new and improved nexelit-based one. Allowing a way better use of energy and enough pressure to keep trits happy.
fi=A total of 5-6 irrigations are added during germination including pre-sowing irrigation, improving consumption and production.
fungicide=Nauvis soil isn't welcome to tuuphras. Spray fungicide to avoid the dreaded "Late Blight" disease. Sometimes phosphates are necessary. These chemicals will speed up the crop's growth, but they will also cause lots of pollution.
tr=Recycle the smaller and discarded tuuphra tubes as a source of organic starches and greases.
evoa=Deep research and gene implementation from earth's arthropods will turn vonix less alien and more earth-like. This technology allows investment into live birthing for vonixes.
uge=Insert a defective gene that causes dysregulation in vonix's metabolism, speeding up their growth but making their lives miserable. Cancerous subcultures are harvestable from the vonix's enclosure.
dermal=Cross breed vonix with common biter to generate a new sub-species with better skin protection allowing vonix to dig in practically any substrate, reducing costs in enclosure placement.
ap=Allow xenos to incorporate more of the host's DNA allowing them to use any level and species of hosts, any sex and age to develop their final forms.
herm=Xenos will have the ablity to sidestep parthenogenesis. When a low genetic variability is detected, allow some of them to change sexes during life in an attempt to recover the genetic pool by sexual reproduction.
hive=Insertion of arthurian's gens allows xenos to have a collective consciousness directed by the queen, who can call back and give orders to her subjects using shrieks and telepathy, more organization means less waste. This modification will allow the queen to communicate telepathically with other advanced species, such as you, inducing terrifying dreams and religious visions which may even lead to the formation of cults with the xenos as the god-like figures.
temp-c=Use smoldering coals and frozen nitrogen to rapidly cycle simulated temperature changes. Xyhiphoe larvae will be stimulated to mature faster, from 14 to 8 sols for metamorphosis to a benthic stage.
rst=Intervenes at the life cycle stage when larvae are "competent" or ready to settle, attach to clutch, and metamorphose to become a "spat". This is the eyed stage at which the larvae can be safely removed from the culture medium to grow alone, preventing losses from competition.
reuse-ev=Import wastewater from other aquacultures to prepare and feed xyhiphoe's favorite phytoplankton. The plankton are able to separate and reconstitute trace amounts of dissolved acetone in the wastewater. 
sub-s=Substrates are a matter of competition. To improve efficiency, the growing medium needs to be sterilized or pasteurized. This kills off any competing mold or bacteria and gives yaedols the best chance at dominating any competition. A large amount of energy will be required to properly and evenly pasteurize the soil.
duct=Re-configure the ducting installation to bring heated air into the growing space. The fungus is able to fully purify and chill the nearby atmosphere.
humidity-control=Install hygrometers to self regulate the better humidity levels for yaedols, making them absorb CO2 from air efficiently. The yaedols will be able to more effectively expel their spores into the environment through runoff, groundwater, and evaporation. These additional spores can be collected by the spore collector.
cryopreservation=Advanced freezing methods help preserve seed genetics during the offseason. The non-depreciative storage allow fruit development and vegetative development runs as natural as it was planted without it.
harvest=Automated machinery and robots are used instead of simple inserters, increasing the quality of the leaves and fruits (since they won't harm them during the harvest). These agribots can also detects dying plants before orchard know they are dying.
nutrinet=Develop the Nutrinet, an AI controlled system that uses electronic sensors.These high resolution sensors can evaluate soil quality based on available nutrients detected in the soil.Instead of fertilizing an entire field equally, now the AI knows which areas need the most fertilizer and which areas need the least. This not only decreases fertilizer costs, it gives a more even, fuller crop yield from the yotoi fruit and leaves.
suicide=Further studies reveal that artificial abdominal disengagement of the chitinous protrusion from the sternite of zipirs is required before males can mate in any early stage of development. The procedure allows them to have 100% success in breeding even when immature, but they can't live longer without this organ system. Considering maturation for a full adult zipir can take decades, its a valid technique if you don't care about ethics on this planet.
sr=Insert modified tranpogens from trits into zipir's genoma to allow females develop a spermatheque to retain sperm after mating so that 2 or even 3 egg masses can be produced without the further intervention of another male.
hatchery=Build an attachment of zipir's reefs dedicated to provide great water conditions to zipir's eggs and larvae hatches naturally. By doing that, recycling the waste water from the main tank will severe reduce the pollution and energy costs.
geooxidation=Six tandem copies of yeadols monomers were cloned into pBC1 vector of zungrors carapace, allowing them to absorb important minerals directly from the soil.
genooscillation=Allows rapid gene oscillation during meiosis, improving genetic variability. In all procedures, the varible spinneret kiloglider organ will be multiplied.
oviduct-bombardment=With great power comes great responsibility. Insert highly radioactive isotopes into the zungror's diet. The zungror oviducts will overcompensate and allow higher availability of the spidroins in the cocoons.
xgv=Using common retroviral technology to keep zungror's genome without degradation. Even improving the quality of cocoon proteins.
