ud=Cottonguts are very sensitive to ultrasound. It affects them negatively, to avoid low reproduction rates, install ultrasound dampers in the walls of the prandium labs, blocking unwanted ultrasound to affect cottonguts.
moon=Moondrops got their name because their flowers only open under the light from one of nauvis' moons. Install special, high-powered lamps into the greenhouse and improve production by constantly simulating nauvis moonlight.
cu=Moondrops have several copper-containing enzymes that play an important role in photosynthesis, respiration and the formation of lignin. This process requires soil rich in copper and is what gives them their distinct blueish colors. Nauvis soil naturally has trace amounts of copper however the addition of raw copper ore into their fertilization routine will improve the crop yield.
carbon-capture=Install small filters that will absorb escaping CO2 from the greenhouse, helping moondrops in their carbon capture. Allows self-sufficent produciton of CO2 without external inputs.

h2-recycle=Burn excess hydrogen to not only generate extra power for the enclosure, but use the water generated to irrigate the ralesias.
deadheading=Rennea blossoms can sometimes die off quickly and become "deadheads". Re-program the plantation machinery to automatically detect and remove these defects. Using a special growth procedure, these deadheads can be recycled into useful native flora. 
alltime=Double irrigation will make rennea blooms all year. Will increase consuption and production.
aphid-cleaning=Renneas are very suscetible to disease pests such aphids, to improve production, we added biter gens into them, making the aphids believe they aren't plants anymore.
ms=Upgrade the energy plasma control system to use nexelit-based substrates, helping in the speed of ionic measures in the mass-to-charge ratio of the object of study.
mci=Uses the research lab¬¥s neutron drive core to analyze and return data from the experiments. It will decrase the speed since its a shared core, but will return even more valuable data.
spg=Uses know and secure alien substances to reduce the amount of work and reagents in the analysis.
neuron=Splicing an arthurian nural gen into scrondrix genoma will allow their brain cells to intercommunicate at near light speed, increasing their intelligence at a geometric scale. This procedure is very dangerous but it will result in significantly more nural material when slaughtered. If this material is eaten, it grants a temporary alien <-> human speech capability.
boronb=Scrondrix brain chemistry is completely diffrent to anything found on earth. Apparently, boron derivatives can act as a performance enchancing and hallucinogenic substance to scrondrix biology. By force-feeding boron trioxide they will gain a great reproductive boost.
hspa=Crosslink alkali dissociation in their intestines will allow scrondrixes to function on a pure vegan diet after maturation. A fully plant-based diet will generally lead to a reduction in overall energy and activity, espically in such a large mammal.
unstable=The exotic energy source of simiks is being studied and recent discoveries says phosphorous salts are the base of its most basic energy molecule. Add phosphorous to their food will optimize their metabolism.
arcanium=Bombard simik¬¥s arcaniums (organs responsible for procreation) with microwaves can induce heat, boosting their production.
etelnav=Install patented Etelnav systems to use waste heat from that enclosure to generate power.
flagellum=Creates a new generation of sponges with triple the amount of flagellum in their choanocytes, promoting better water flow and feeding, increasing speed.
fragmentation=When a sponge grows enough, it will break fragment its own branches. If landed into a suitable substrate, their mesophyl will reshape and attach to the new place, making a new sponge.
bacterial=Mutate choanocytes to capture and engulf bacteria in the water, reducing the need of food and sterilizing the water.
mgo=Trits have metagenesis breeding cycles, which mean they have individuals just to grow and other just to procreate. Inserting a common ancient Earth gene from mammals can turn this creature into a complete typical breeding cycle leading to more offspring.
dc=Uses nanomachines to intentionally create non-depreciative mutations in trits DNA, allowing them to improve a lot their genetic poll and by that, improving your selective breeding.
nexelit-axis=Change the pressure pumps main axis for a new and improved nexelit-based one. Allowing a way better use of energy and enough pressure to keep trits happy.
fi=Total 5-6 irrigations are added, including pre-sowing irrigation, improving consuption and production.
fungicide=Nauvis soil isn't welcome to tuuphras. Spray fungicide to avoid the dreaded "Late Blight" disease. Sometimes mercury is necessary, it will speed up the crop, but pollutes a lot.
tr=Use the smaller and discarted tubes as a source for the new crop.
evoa=Deep research and gene implementation from earth¬¥s arthopods will turn vonix less alien and more earth-like, knowing that, we can invest in more common ways to reproduction.
uge=Insert a defective gene that dysregulation vonix¬¥s metabolism, speeding up their growth but make their lives miserable.
dermal=Cross breed vonix with common bitter to generate a new sub-species with better skin protection allowing vonix to dig in practically any substrate, reducing costs in enclosure placement.
ap=Allow xenos to incorporate more of the host¬¥s DNA allowing them to use any level and species of hosts, any sex and age to develop their final forms.
herm=Allow xenos to, aside use parthenogenesis, when detected a low genetic variability, allow some of them to change sexes during life, in attempt to recover the genetic pool by sexual reproduction.
hive=Insertion of arthurian¬¥s gens allows xenos to have a collective consciousness directed by the queen, who can call back and give orders to her subjects using shrieks and telepathy, more organization means less waste. Distance is required, this modification will allow the queen communicates telepathically with other advanced species, such as you, inducing terrifying dreams and religious visions, which may even lead to the formation of cults with the xenos as a god-like figures.
temp-c=Simulate temperature changes will stimulate xyhiphoe larvae to mature faster, from 14 to 8 sols for metamorphosis to a benthic stage.
rst=Intervenes at the life cycle stage when larvae are "competent" or ready to settle, attach to cultch, and metamorphose to become a "spat". This is the eyed stage at which the larvae can be safely removed from the culture medium to grow alone, reducing loses.
reuse-ev=Import every waste from other aquacultures in your base to prepare and feed xyhiphoe¬¥s favorite phytoplankton.
sub-s=Substrate are a matter of competition. To improve efficiency, the substrate needs to be sterilized or pasteurized. This kills off any competing mold or bacteria and gives yaedols the best chance at taking hold.
duct=Add a simple ducting installation bringing air in and out of the growing space.
humidity-control=Install hygrometers to self regulate the better humidity levels for yaedols, making them absorb CO2 from air efficiently.
cryopreservation=Advanced freezing methods help preserve seed genetics during the offseason. The non-depreciative storage allow fruit development and vegetative development runs as natural as it was planted without it.
harvest=Automated machinery and robots are used instead of simple inserters, increasing the quality of the leaves and fruits (since they won't harm them during the harvest). These agribots can also detects dying plants before orchard know they are dying.
nutrinet=Develop the Nutrinet, an AI controled system that uses electronic sensors.These high resolution sensors can evaluate soil quality based on available nutrients detected in the soil.Instead of fertilizing an entire field equally, now the AI knows which areas need the most fertilizer and which areas need the least. This not only decreases fertilizer costs, it gives a more even, fuller crop yield from the yotoi fruit and leaves.
suicide=Further studies reveal that artificial abdominal disengagement of the chitinous protrusion from the sternite of zipirs is required before males can mate in any early stage of development. The procedure allows them to have 100% sucesss in breeding even when immature, but they can't live longer without this organ system. Considering a maturation for a full adult zipir can take decades, its a valid technique if you don't care about ethics in this planet.
sr=Insert modified tranpogens from trits into zipir¬¥s genoma to allow females develop a spermatheque to retain sperm after mating so that 2 or even 3 egg masses can be produced without the further intervention of another male.
hatchery=Build an attachment of zipir¬¥s reefs dedicated to provide great water conditions to zipir¬¥s eggs and larvae hatches naturally. By doing that, recycling the waste water from the main tank will severe reduce the pollution and energy costs.
geooxidation=Six tandem copies of yeadols monomers were cloned into pBC1 vector of zungrors carapace, allowing them to absorb important minerals direct from soil, minerals that are used to improve its welfare.
genooscillation=Allows gene jumping during meiosis, improving genetic variability.
oviduct-bombardment=Using X-rays into zungror's oviducts will allow more availability of the spidroins in the cocoons.
