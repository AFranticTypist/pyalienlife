manure production isnt high enough - good for early/ mid game. will need to move to/ need to add synth fertilizer


Move pesticide01 to pre py science or pesticide02 to later

replace ralesia with ralesia extract and dry ralesia in some of the foods.

look at animal foods

fix the unnesssary addition of nothing to auog pup recipes to auog pup to caged auogs

REMOVE RANDOM CRAP TO AUOG MANURE RECIPES. manure will be produced as part of the growth cycle from pups to adults and the breeding area

look into useing pheromones as an improved breeding recipe for auog pups after t4

get rid of normal auogs to improved and replace with auog super solder program

TODO:
VRAUKS FOR GREEN SCIENCE

look into making biosample hand minable and vrauks aviable at start
